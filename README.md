# C-SFML-Alleyway-Clone-Game
‘Alleyway Clone’ builds on John Horton’s ‘Pong’ example from his book, ‘Beginning C++ Game Programming’ book (published by Packt>) as a starting point.  This project takes a similar path to a project I created earlier, titled ‘Breakout Clone’.  However, Alleyways Clone utilizes graphics to represent the various objects (i.e., the paddle, the ball, the bricks) in the game and generates a random configuration of level designs.  As well, there is more diversity added to the bricks in the game, such as some bricks are hard to destroy than others (i.e., take multiple hits) and other bricks increases the difficulty of the game (i.e., increases the ball’s speed for 30 seconds).
